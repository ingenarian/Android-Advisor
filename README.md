# Android-Advisor
An experimental Model-View-Controller (MVC) client-server program created in late 2014 to help users with short-term goals. The GUI provides the following features: Profiles (user registration) and Goals (user selection). The program uses SQLite for data persistence. See the use case diagam. The code is located in a zipped folder called Week_8a.zip.
